# Tattoo Studio Frontend Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop the user interface of a website for a tattoo studio, enabling users to create accounts, manage their profiles, and schedule appointments.

## Project Description

This frontend project has been developed using Node.js as the runtime environment and React as the library for integrating JavaScript and HTML. The website includes various views, such as:

- **Home**
- **Services**
- **Artists**
- **Login**
- **Sign Up**
- **Profile Panel**
- **Appointments Panel**
- **Create New Appointments**

Administrators have access to a special panel for user management. This frontend communicates with an API that interacts with a MySQL database.
